**Cats** (*Felis catus*) are domesticated mammals of the *Felidae* family. This family is divided by subfamilies of *Pantherinae* (lions, tigers) who roar, and *Felinae* (cougars, domestic cats) who purr. Domestic cats have retractable claws, powerful bodies, good senses, long tails, and sharp teeth to hunt prey. 

## Origin of cats
The first feline-like mammal was the *Proailurus* which evolved about 30 million years ago. All true cat species are thought to have evolved from this predator. Cats that resemble the ones we know today first evolved 5.3 to 3.6 million years ago where they had few changes into the present time. The development of fangs, claws, agility, flexibile and muscular bodies allowed cats to survive and hunt while adapting to changing prey as well.

## Domestication
Unlike dogs, domesticated cats were nearly identical to their wild counterparts and remained highly independent. This meant that cats could not be fully domesticated. Around 10,000 - 15,000 years ago in the Middle East, a relationship developed between humans and cats when humans began relying on agriculture as opposed to hunter-gatherer methods for food. Cats initially became pest contol, helping keeping rodents out of crops. Domestic cats eventually spread throughout the world through trade routes as they were considered as companions. They even held high status in certain cultures, such as ancient Egypt.

## Identifying cats
Differences in domestic cat breeds are usually subtle, compared to dog breeds and are typically identified from phsyical characteristics. These characteristics include color, coat pattern, body size, or hair length. Some examples of how cat breeds are identified are "black", "orange tabby", "longhaired", "shorthaired". The varying coat colors of domestic cats come from mutation. However, all domestic cats are tabbies by genetics, as they have genes for one or more of tabby patterns. These patterns include the classic (blotched) tabby, mackerel tabby, ticked tabby, and spotted.
